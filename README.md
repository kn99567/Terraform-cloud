## Prerequisites

Before diving into the demos, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Terraform Cloud account
- Terraform CLI installed
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account

## Folder Structure

This repository is organized into two main folders:

- `gke`: This folder is designed for experienced Terraform Cloud users who want to start with a clean slate. It demonstrates how to set up a Terraform Cloud workspace with a blank state.

- `demo_migration`: If you have an existing Terraform state file and want to migrate it to Terraform Cloud, this folder provides step-by-step instructions on how to do just that.
